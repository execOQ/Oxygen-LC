### Information

Adds the need to have oxygen tanks behind your back. Moving around the planet also consumes oxygen, 
since not all planets are habitable. You can also breathe underwater! However, you have a limited amount of oxygen, 
don't forget to replenish the supply of oxygen cylinder on the ship!

  <summary>Compatibility with other mods</summary>
  
  #### Compatible with: 
  
  * EladsHUD (screenshot below)
  * ShyHUD (HUD disappears if a oxygen value is > 75)
  * LCVR (screenshot below). Works with Arm HUD enabled and disabled
  * ImmersiveVisor (Additional oxygen consumption if the helmet is cracked)


  > Probably compatible with OopsAllFlooded but you'll find two oxygen canisters. One is from the Oxygen mod (OxyBoost) and one is from the OopsAllFlooded mod (Oxy-Canister). The working one is from this mod and is called OxyBoost.
